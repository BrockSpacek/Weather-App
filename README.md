Weather App
Description: Creating a weather App that pulls from an API and designing it like my client's Figma that was given to me.

Design: Only designed for 1440px 

Figma Link: https://www.figma.com/design/67J96QA4Gb7SCOD6rRo4es/KumarTP-WeatherSprint?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=noj6588h5ktD8H07-0

Peer Review: Juan Heredia

Comments: everything works fine, my only real nitpick is that theres a random button on the bottom left that says "api test" si you should probably remove that
